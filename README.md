The codes are in the "demos/simple" folder.

The main code is in the file "simple.js". 
The file "map_data.js" provides the input for the main code. 
The files "street_features.js" and "unit_features.js" could be useful for future steps.
The files "interface.js" and " agentmaps.js" are needed to run the software (they do not refer to the simulation).
